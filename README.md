InSynth Plugin
==============

This project brings [InSynth](http://lara.epfl.ch/w/insynth)
completions to the Scala IDE for Eclipse.

InSynth is a tool for interactive synthesis of code snippets. It
applies theorem proving technology to synthesize code fragments that
use given library functions. InSynth synthesizes code applying
polymorphic type constraints as well as code behavior.

Build and Run
=============

You need to have [Scala IDE for Eclipse](http://scala-ide.org) and the
[Equinox Weaving
Launcher](https://github.com/milessabin/equinox-weaving-launcher) (and
of course, Eclipse). Read the [Setting up guide](http://scala-ide.org/docs/dev/setup/setup.html) on the Scala IDE
developer documentation to learn about how to setup the Scala IDE
project and how to launch it in the debugger.

For the moment there is no update site, so you need to build your own
plugin.
